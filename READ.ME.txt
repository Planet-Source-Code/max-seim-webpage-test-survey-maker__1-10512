View the examples included to see how
the scripts are made.  Click on FILE and
then OPEN to open the examples.

If you are making a new script:

You can use Notepad (probably the best thing)
or you can use the Text box.  If you type in
the script in the text box or make changes to
a script in the text box, SAVE the file (changes)
and then Re-OPEN it to make it current.

You will see where the file (resulting HTML) will
be saved when you view the results in your browser.

Once you put in your email (where the results will
be sent), it will remember it for next time.

The 'html form' is emailed back using a "free" website
CGI script that the author (www.thalasson.com) has allowed the public to use.
You may want to create your own CGI script in your webspace
(if you know how to do it).

Some important notes on making the script:

When entering possible answers, leave only one space
between the [r] and the  a)
example:
[r] a) This option

Always include either a letter or number for each
possible answer.
example
[r] a) This option
[r] b) this one

[r] 1) Or a number
[r] 2) second option

Same thing goes for checkboxes.

These unique letters or numbers for options will be
important when the person emails the answers.  You will
see this when you try it out.

[n] Where n=question number
[r] Where r=radio button
[c] Where c=check button
[s] Where s=short answer (40 char , 1 line ... fixed)
[l] Where l=long answer (40 char, 4 lines displayed ... automatically adds more)
